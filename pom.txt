developer has their own private repository to track their changes in.
 You make your changes locally and when you’re ready to share
 them with other developers, you push them back to the rep
ository you all share. Commit saves the changes
 you made only to the local repository b
ut not to the remote repository. Your
 commits are not automatically synchronized to the
 remote repository – you
 have to explicitly push the commits you want to share.
 When you use the push command,
 you apply your changes to the upstream repository.
